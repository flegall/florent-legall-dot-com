**Do you refactor your code ?**

Everyone one day or another refactors their code.

When the change can be made in a few hours, you just do it straight away, the tests pass, you commit / push and that's it.

But sometimes the change cannot be made in an afternoon, then you usually commit it in a separate branch and you or someone else start working on something else in the meantime.
