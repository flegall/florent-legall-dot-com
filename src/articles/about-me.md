I'm a **software engineer**, I've been working since 2004.

I've worked at various companies from 5 person **startups** to > 100.000 person **mega companies**.

I'm a **passionate** developer, I've written software of many kind in various domains : public transportation, air traffic control, project management software, IT automation, release management, insurance, television.

**I enjoy particularly building user interfaces**. User interfaces are in my opinion the most fun to create. They usually give a fast and rewarding feedback when building, they get users excited, they give us nice challenges, and you never know exactly what you are going to build until you build it.

I'm currently working at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). (Updated since I first wrote the original article in 2019)

I've written :

- **a lot of Java** in the past (roughly 10 years)
- a bit of **Scala** (1 year)
- quite a lot of **JavaScript** (5 years)

I like :

- **static typing** (Scala, Flow, TypeScript).
- all kinds of **driven development/design** (type-driven, test-driven, domain-driven, behaviour-driven, data-driven).
- **pair/mob programming** : having more than one brain in front of a single monitor.

Besides work:

- I **cook**.
- I'm **acting** at the theater. I've played roles in 7 differents plays over the last 12 years.
- I'm a father and a husband.
